# Elavate Labs - Task 06

## Objective
To create different passwords of variying complexity & evaluate its strength.  

## Passwords Used & Scores
1. "password" : Score: 8%, Length: 8, Uppercase: 0, Lowercase: 8, Numbers: 0, Symbols: 0 
2. "Password123" : Score: 75%, Length: 11, Uppercase: 1, Lowercase: 7, Numbers: 3, Symbols: 0
3. "Password@123" : Score: 93%, Length: 12, Uppercase: 1, Lowercase: 7, Numbers: 3, Symbols: 1
4. "NigtinGAle##6534" : Score: 100%, Length: 16, Uppercase: 3, Lowercase: 7, Numbers: 4, Symbols: 2

## Best practices for creating passwords
Based on the evaluation, the identified best practices for creating passwords are as follows:  
1. Password lenght should be atlest 12+ characters.
2. Include uppercase, lowercase , numbers & sysmbols.
3. Try to avoid dictionary words, use phrases.
4. Try to reduce the number of consecutive uppercase or lowercase characters in the password.

## Common Password Attacks
1. Brute Force Attack – Trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.
2. Dictionary Attack – Using a predefined list of common passwords or words to guess the password.
3. Credential Stuffing – Using leaked username–password pairs from previous breaches to access other accounts.
4. Phishing – Tricking users into revealing their passwords via fake websites, emails, or messages.
5. Keylogging – Capturing keystrokes on a compromised device to steal passwords as they are typed.
6. Rainbow Table Attack – Using precomputed hash–password pairs to quickly crack hashed passwords.
7. Man-in-the-Middle Attack – Intercepting communication between the user and system to capture login credentials.
8. Password Spraying – Trying a few common passwords across many accounts to avoid account lockouts.

## Summary 
Longer and more complex passwords (mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) have exponentially more possible combinations, making them harder and slower to crack with brute force or guessing attacks.
